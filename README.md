# Quik

Quik is a blazing fast web IDE.

## Tech Stack

Personally, the purpose of this project is to explore Next.js and TailwindCSS.
As I build out more features for the IDE itself, I will make design decisions that optimize performance.

For now, the tech stack is - 
1. Next.js
2. TailwindCSS
3. SQLite3


Potential technologies that may be implemented - 
1. GraphQL ( I really want to try urql )
2. A dedicated server (non-Next.js) for remote code execution (Bazel, gRPC?), probably written using Go.
